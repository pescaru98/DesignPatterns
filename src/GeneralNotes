Framework Designer/Creator -> The one who create the framework, using design patterns
Client -> The one who uses the framework

The "Demo" part/class of Design Patterns represent the way client uses the classes. The rest of the classes consists of the structure made by the framework creator.

In some patterns, there are already some classes implemented by the framework creator. So, in addition, the framework creator realise some sort of problems,
and come up with some further implementation that define that pattern (those patterns usually are patterns that don't come up at the begging of the implementation of that framework,
but more likely as a refactoring).

In other patterns, the full implementation is started from the beggining.
